# New GitHub Report Bash Script

Make creating a new github repo easy!! All it takes is ONE command in your terminal. 

## Setup

First clone this repo. 

You will then need to create a global environment variable to hold your GitHub Personal Token. Give the variable the name `GITHUB_TOKEN`

Finally you may also want to create an alias to the script to simplify running the script. For example I have given mine the alias `newghrepo`. 

## Use

*This assumes you gave your script the alias of `newghrepo`*

In your terminal type: `newghrepo <name of repo>` eg `newghrepo new-github-repo`
